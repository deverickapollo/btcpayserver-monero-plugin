## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, we strongly encourage responsible disclosure.

Please **do not** create public GitHub issues or pull requests for security-related matters.

Instead, report it privately by contacting repository admins:

Include as much information as possible:
- Vulnerability description
- Affected version(s)

We aim to respond within **3 days** and will coordinate disclosure once a fix is available.
